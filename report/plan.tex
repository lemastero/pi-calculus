\section{Plan}

Currently, we have completed most of our background research, and have started building a small web server in Haskell. The purpose of the latter is firstly to learn more about web frameworks in general, and secondly, once we have built a basic implementation, we can start to see how easy it will be to interact with conventional servers.

\subsection{Milestone Dates}

There are roughly 20 weeks between now and 23\textsuperscript{rd} June, the preliminary archive submission deadline. We therefore aim to split that time into ten periods of two weeks, and at the end of each of those periods we would like to achieve the following:
\subsubsection{7\textsuperscript{th} March} 
Basic playground built    
\subsubsection{21\textsuperscript{st} March}
Able to parse a subset of the language \verb![ 0, in , out , let , ; , | ]! 
\subsubsection{4\textsuperscript{th} April}  
Basic interaction with small servers i.e. \verb!in(a,message);out(a,message)!   
\subsubsection{18\textsuperscript{th} April}
Able to parse \verb?[if then else, new, !]?    
\subsubsection{2\textsuperscript{nd} May}    
Basic handling of types  
\subsubsection{16\textsuperscript{th} May}   
Able to parse basic functions such as \verb!pair(x,y) , enc(x)!  
\subsubsection{30\textsuperscript{th} May}     
\subsubsection{13\textsuperscript{th} June}     
\subsubsection{20\textsuperscript{th} June}     
\subsubsection{23\textsuperscript{rd} June}     
\subsubsection{27\textsuperscript{th} June}     
\subsubsection{30\textsuperscript{th} June}
