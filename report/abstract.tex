\section*{Abstract}

Typically, when defining a security protocol, we do not concern ourselves with how it might be implemented. The languages we use to describe protocols are too abstract to execute, and the languages we use to implement protocols are too convoluted to reason about.
Here we provide our implementation of the Applied $\pi$-calculus, with which one can combine definition and reasoning with implementation. 
Imagine a carpenter. He can design the perfect piece of furniture on paper, but when he puts it together there's always the danger he might forget a screw. There is always room for error in implementation. It would be better if the carpenter could just lift his design straight off the page -- in other words, if the design was the implementation.
