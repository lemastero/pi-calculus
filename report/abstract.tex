\section*{Abstract}

Typically, when defining a security protocol, we do not concern ourselves with how it might be implemented. The languages we use to describe protocols are too abstract to execute, and the languages we use to implement protocols are too convoluted to reason about.

Here we provide our implementation of the Applied $\pi$-calculus, with which one can combine definition and reasoning with implementation.
