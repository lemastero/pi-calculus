\section{Evaluation}

There are 6 levels of success we would like to achieve over the course of this project. In increasing order of difficulty they are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Basic interaction with controlled environment
    \item Moderate coverage of language by compiler (in, out, parallel composition, sequential composition, limited replication) 
    \item Models for a few more basic protocols, such as a naive handshake protocol
    \item Responsive concurrency and fast compilation
    \item Complete language compilation (pattern matching, de-structuring, user defined functions and types)
    \item Fully interoperable compiled models
\end{enumerate}
