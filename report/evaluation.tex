\section{Evaluation}

There are 6 points of success we would like to achieve over the course of this project. In increasing order of difficulty they are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Basic interaction with controlled environment
    \item Moderate coverage of language by compiler (in, out, parallel composition, sequential composition, limited replication, basic types and functions) 
    \item Models for a few more basic protocols, such as a naive handshake protocol
    \item Responsive concurrency and fast compilation
    \item Complete language compilation (pattern matching, de-structuring, user defined functions and types)
    \item Fully interoperable compiled models
\end{enumerate}

We would consider the project a success if we were to achieve the first 3 of these fully, and at least one of the following three partially.

Overall the aim of this project is to create something which is easy to use, and which can interact with a number of different processes and systems. As we have demonstrated with some of our background research, interaction on a single kind of channel seems feasible, and this makes us optimistic for final product which can achieve our goal.
