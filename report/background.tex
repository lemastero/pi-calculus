\subsection{CCS, $\pi$-calculus and the applied $\pi$-calculus}

The applied $\pi$-calculus \cite{af01} is an extension of $\pi$-calculus \cite{mpw92} which itself as an extension of the work Robert Milner did on the Calculus of Communicating Systems (CCS) \cite{m82}. Here we will give a brief introduction to all three, and show how each extends upon the next.
\[
\begin{array}[b]{l l}
 P ::= & \emptyset \\
  &a.P_{1}\\
  &A\\
  &P_{1} + P_{2} \\
  &P_{1} | P_{2} \\
  &P_{1} [\frac{b}{a}]\\
  &P_{1} \backslash a 
\end{array}

\subsubsection{Parsec}

Parsec is a monadic parser combinator library for Haskell which is fast, robust, simple and well-documented \cite{lm01}. We use parsec by building a series of low-level parsers and combining them into a single high level one.
A basic parser that matches agains an
